       1. General provisions
			<br/>
			<br/>
These Policies of procedure for prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and compliance with international sanctions lay down requirements for screening the Clients in order to prevent entering into deals involving suspected money laundering and terrorist financing, and to ensure identification and reporting of such in case of existence of a risk determined by the Company. These AML/KYC Policies shall be applied in case of any issue related with money or financial transaction(s) is occurred.
			<br/>
The Rules are primarily based on the regulations of AML/KYC legislation applicable and international sanctions acts.
			<br/>
			<br/>
         2. Application of due diligence measures
			<br/>
			<br/>
The Company shall determine and take due diligence measures using results of conducted international risk assessment and provisions of national risk assessment.
			<br/>
The Representatives shall pay special attention to circumstances that refer to Money Laundering or Terrorist Financing.
			<br/>
Depending on the level of the risk of the Client and depending on the fact whether the business relationship is an existing one or it is about to be established, the Company shall apply either normal KYC/AML measures, simplified KYC/AML measures or enhanced KYC/AML measures. The Company may also apply continuous KYC/AML measures to ensure ongoing monitoring of business relationships.
			<br/>
KYC/AML measures may include, but are not limited with, the following procedures:
			<br/>
           o Identifying the Client and verifying its identity using reliable, independent sources, documents or data, including e-identifying;
			<br/>
           o Identifying and verifying of the representative of the Client and the right of representation;
			<br/>
           o Identifying the Client's Beneficial Owner;
			<br/>
           o Assessing and, as appropriate, obtaining information on the purpose of the business relationship;
			<br/>
           o Conducting ongoing KYC/AML on the Client's business to ensure the Company’s knowledge of the Client and its source of funds is
			<br/>
               correct;
			<br/>
           o Obtaining information whether the Client is a PEP or PEP’s family member or PEP’s close associate;
			<br/>
           o Obtaining information from any third party, e.g. government authorities.
			<br/>
The Company may establish the source of wealth of the Client, where appropriate.
			<br/>
To comply with the KYC/AML obligation, the Company or any third party appointed by the Company shall have the right and obligation to:
			<br/>
           o request appropriate identity documents to identify the Client and its representatives;
			<br/>
           o request documents and information regarding the activities of the Client and legal origin of funds;
			<br/>
           o request information about beneficial owners of a legal person;
			<br/>
           o screen the risk profile of the Client, select the appropriate KYC/AML measures, assess the risk whether the Client is or may become
			<br/>
              involved in money laundering or terrorist financing;
			<br/>
           o re-identify the Client or the representative of the Client, if there are any doubts regarding the correctness of the information received
			<br/>
              in the course of initial identification.

			<br/>
           o Keeping up-to-date the documents, data or information, obtained during taking KYC/AML measures;
			<br/>
           o Paying particular attention to Client’s actions, leading to criminal activity or money laundering or terrorist financing;
			<br/>
           o Paying particular attention to Client’s actions, leading to criminal activity or money laundering or terrorist financing;
			<br/>
