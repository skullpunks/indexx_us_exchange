			<br/>
           o there is a breach of these Terms, indexx.ai’s Terms of Service or indexx.ai’s guidelines by Referral (including when such breach is due to

			<br/>
This limitation applies regardless of whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, warranty, negligence, strict liability or any other basis, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages or such damages were reasonably foreseeable. Because certain jurisdictions do not permit the limitation or elimination of liability for consequential or incidental damages, our liability in such jurisdictions shall be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

			<br/>
Upon violation of these Terms, indexx.ai’s Terms of Service or indexx.ai’s guidelines for the first time, Affiliate Account would be suspended, resulting in blocking of referral link and API key until further clarification from Affiliate, providing enough evidence to prove lack of violation on Affiliate’s side or cure of the relevant breach by Affiliate.
			<br/>
Upon violation of these Terms, indexx.ai’s Terms of Service or indexx.ai’s guidelines for the second time, Affiliate Account is blocked, resulting in blocking of access to Affiliate Account.

			<br/>
The Affiliate is only eligible to earn Commissions on Qualified Transactions occurring during the Term which are payable only if the related orders are not cancelled or refunded. Indexx.ai may withhold Affiliate’s final payment for a reasonable time to ensure that the correct amount is paid and to confirm that all Qualified Transactions are finalized.
			<br/>

You agree to defend, release, indemnify and hold harmless indexx.ai, as well as indexx.ai’s contractors, agents, employees, officers, directors, shareholders, and affiliates, from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, costs and expenses (attorney’s fees and court costs), relating to or arising under these Terms, the service(s) provided by indexx.ai, or your use of the service(s) provided by indexx.ai and resulting from:
			<br/>
           o any breach, non-compliance, or non-performance by you of the representations, warranties or covenants pursuant to these Terms; or
			<br/>
           o infringement by you or by anyone else using such service(s) we provide to you of intellectual property or other proprietary right(s) of
			<br/>
              any individual or entity.
			<br/>
If any third party makes a claim, or notifies an intention to make a claim against Indexx.ai (“Claim”), which may reasonably be considered likely to give rise to a liability under this Section, you shall:
			<br/>
           o as soon as reasonably practicable, give a written notice of the Claim to Indexx.ai specifying the nature of the Claim in detail;
			<br/>
           o not make any admission of liability, agreement or compromise in relation to the Claim without our prior written consent (such consent
			<br/>
              not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed).
			<br/>
The foregoing obligations in this Section will survive the termination of this agreement.
			<br/>
			<br/>
      11. Confidentiality; Publicity
			<br/>
			<br/>
You agree to protect the confidentiality of any non-public information of a confidential or proprietary nature that you obtain in connection with the Program (“Confidential Information”), including, without limitation, data (including personal data) related to Referrals. You will not retain or use the Confidential Information except to the extent necessary for you to perform this agreement, and you will not disclose Confidential Information to any third party except to your accountants, attorneys or other agents on a confidential basis, or as required by law (for example, to comply with a subpoena), provided that prior to any disclosure required by law you give advance written notice to indexx.ai and allow indexx.ai to object and seek protective treatment or pursue other actions regarding such Confidential Information. The foregoing obligations in this Section 11 will survive the termination of this agreement.
			<br/>
No Publicity. You may not issue a press release or otherwise refer to indexx.ai in any manner in connection with the Program or these Terms, without the prior written consent of indexx.ai.
			<br/>
			<br/>
       12. General
			<br/>
			<br/>
Final agreement. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Indexx.ai in relation with, or connection to, the Program and supersedes all previous agreements or understandings between the parties in connection with the Program.
			<br/>
Section headings. The section headings appearing in these Terms are inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section or in any way affect such section.
			<br/>
Force Majeure. Neither party shall be deemed in default hereunder, nor shall it hold the other party responsible for, any cessation, interruption or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder due to causes beyond its control including, but not limited to: earthquake; flood; fire; storm; natural disaster; act of God; war; terrorism; armed conflict; labour strike; lockout; boycott; supplier failures, shortages, breaches, or delays; or any law, order regulation, direction, action or request of the government, including any federal, state and local governments having or claiming jurisdiction over Indexx.ai, or of any department, agency, commission, bureau, corporation or other instrumentality of any federal, state, or local government, or of any civil or military authority; or any other cause or circumstance, whether of a similar or dissimilar nature to the foregoing, beyond the reasonable control of the affected party, provided that the party relying upon this section:
			<br/>
           o shall have given the other party written notice thereof promptly and, in any event, within five (5) days of discovery thereof and
			<br/>
           o shall take all steps reasonably necessary under the circumstances to mitigate the effects of the force majeure event upon which such
			<br/>
              notice is based; provided further, that in the event a force majeure event described in this Section extends for a period in excess of 
			<br/>
              thirty (30) days in the aggregate, Indexx.ai may immediately terminate this agreement.
			<br/>
Waiver. A waiver of any right or remedy is only effective if given in writing and shall not be deemed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. A delay or failure to exercise, or the single or partial exercise of, any right or remedy shall not:
			<br/>
           o Waive that or any other right or remedy;
			<br/>
           o Prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.
			<br/>
Severability. If any provision of these Terms is or becomes invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal and enforceable. If such modification is not possible, the relevant provision shall be deemed deleted. Any modification to or deletion of a provision under this section shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the rest of this Terms.
			<br/>
No Assignment. The Affiliate may not assign or otherwise transfer, in whole or in part, the rights or obligations under these Terms without the prior written consent signed by an official representative of Indexx.ai
			<br/>
The Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. You agree that any action at law pursued by You and arising out of or relating to the Terms not subject to arbitration (as set forth below) will be filed only in the Court in the jurisdiction where Service Provider is respectively registered and You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of the Terms.
			<br/>
Arbitration. You and Indexx.ai agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or relating to the Service, except that you and Indexx.ai are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyright, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. You and Indexx.ai agree that you will notify each other of any dispute within 30 days of when it arises, that you will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration and that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator. You and Indexx.ai also agree that the court in England and Wales, where Indexx.ai is located has exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. In any arbitration, the parties will not seek discovery from each other, and the arbitrator shall not allow parties to engage in discovery; rather, each party shall disclose the evidence supporting their positions at some mutually agreeable time and date prior to the final hearing. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. Neither you nor Indexx.ai will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by these Terms. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in by a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person, if any Party is a party to the proceeding. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then that language shall be deemed to have been dropped from these Terms and the remaining obligations relating to arbitration shall continue in full force and effect.
