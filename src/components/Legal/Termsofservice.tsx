        <p style={{lineHeight:2,fontSize:20,fontWeight:"bold"}}><br/><br/><img src={legal3} alt=""></img>  RISK DISCLOSURE</p>

        <p style={{lineHeight:2}}><br/><br/>
          Trading of crypto assets involves significant risk. The risk of loss
          in trading or holding crypto assets can be substantial. You should
          therefore carefully consider whether using the Services is suitable
          for You in light of your financial condition. There is no assurance
          that our trading market will be orderly and stable. You should
          exercise prudence in trading in crypto assets (as well as any other
          assets). Prices can and do fluctuate at any given moment for any
          reason. Due to such price fluctuations, You may gain or lose value in
          your assets at any given moment. Any trading position may be subject
          to large swings in value and may even become worthless. The User shall
          bear any loss resulted in his/her own fault or error, including but
          not limited to: not in accordance with the transaction prompts
          operation, not timely trading operations, forgetting or leakage of
          passwords, passwords are cracked, and/or the Users computer is invaded
          or hacked by others.
        </p>

        <p style={{lineHeight:2}}><br/><br/>
          In the event of a potential loophole in the trading rules that
          unjustly enriches the User, we will contact the User to recover the
          gains. The User must effectively cooperate, otherwise, we will take
          actions, including, but not limited to restrictions on account
          transactions, freezing account funds, prosecution of the User in a
          court with right of jurisdiction and other recourse measures. In the
          event that the User does not cooperate, the User will also bear
          recourse costs. Please note that: You may sustain a total loss of the
          crypto assets in your User Address, and, in some cases, you may incur
          losses beyond such crypto assets. Under certain market conditions, you
          may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can
          occur, for example, when the market reaches a daily price fluctuation
          limit (&quot;limit move&quot;) and there is insufficient liquidity in
          the market. Placing instructions in order to recover the transaction,
          will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, since
          market conditions may make it impossible to execute such instructions.
          All crypto assets positions involve risk, and a &quot;spread&quot;
          position may not be less risky than an outright &quot;long&quot; or
          &quot;short&quot; position. All of the points noted above apply to all
          crypto assets. This brief statement cannot, however, disclose all the
          risks and other aspects associated with the Trade of crypto assets and
          shall not be considered as any professional advice.

          transaction&quot;, &quot;Exchanging&quot;, &quot;Sending&quot; and
          &quot;Finished successfully&quot; are non-refundable due to the
          absence of external factors. Service Provider reserves the right to
          review exchange refund requests in the aforementioned statuses on a
          case-by-case basis. Indexx.ai does not guarantee the refund of digital
          assets in case the User fails to comply with the instructions
          accompanying the exchange creation process or as indicated on the
          order page. This condition includes, but is not limited to the

          Sending Digital Assets by the User with an expired contract; o Sending
          deposit by User without obligatory tag (MEMO Destination Pag, Payment
          ID, etc.) if it is indicated on the order page; o Sending deposit
          amount lower than acceptable minimum limit set by Indexx.ai.

        <p style={{lineHeight:2}}><br/><br/>
          Service Provider reserves the right to review each case on an
          individual basis. In some of the aforementioned cases, our liquidity

          of the User&rsquo;s funds. Partner's commission can be deducted from
          the deposit amount or can be charged separately. Refunds are not
          available for: o Counterfeit and imitation assets; o Assets sent in
          the test network. In order to request a refund, the User should
          contact Support through the official communication channels: live chat
          at indexx.ai or by e-mail at support@indexx.ai. We are not responsible
          if the User discloses information on the User's exchanges/transactions
          to third parties or applies for a refund through channels other than
          indicated. Users should not trust personal messages or inquiries
          submitted by individuals claiming to represent Indexx.ai. If you
          cannot confirm that this is an official request from Indexx.ai, please
          contact us directly at support@indexx.ai. Indexx.ai offers users to
          receive a refund to the original address or to the refund address
          entered during the creation of the exchange. However, in some cases

          as the only possible solution. Upon conducting refunds, the support
          service reserves the right to request additional confirmation of the
          deposit ownership by the User in the required form. Upon forwarding
          the refund to the User the payment required to cover the network
          commission may be charged from the original deposit amount. If the
          refunded asset is a token and not the main network coin, the User may
          be requested to make an additional payment in coins of the main
          network to cover the network commission. Indexx.ai shall not be liable
          for any funds sent to fake phishing sites that imitate the original
          Indexx.ai project. User should make sure that User is visiting the
          correct domain indexx.ai. The period during which Indexx.ai holds User
