          Product Description
          <br />
          <br />
          We attempt to be as accurate as possible, however, we do not warrant
          that product descriptions or other content of the website is accurate,
          complete, reliable, current, or error-free. Any reliance on the
          material on this website is at your own risk. We reserve the right to
          modify the contents of this website at any time, but we have no
          obligation to update any information on our website. We reserve the
          right to limit the quantities of any products or services that we
          offer. We reserve the right to discontinue any product at any time. We
          reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit the sales of our
          products to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction.
          <br />
          <br />
          We may change the pricing for the products listed on this website at
          any time subject to no notification. We shall not be liable to You or
          to any third-party for any modification, price change, suspension or
          discontinuance of access to the website or services.
          <br />
          <br />
          We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any
          time. We reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We
          may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per

          prohibit orders that, in our sole judgment, appear to be placed by
          dealers, resellers or distributors.
          <br />
          <br />
          While we have made every effort to ensure continuity and security of
          the Services, we are unable to completely foresee and hedge legal,
          technological and other risks including but not limited to force
          majeure, virus, hacker attack, system instability, flaw in third-party

          Purchase Bonus
          <br />
          <br />
          For the activity on the website and the purchases undertaken via the
          website we retain the right but not an obligation to grant you a
          purchase bonus. We usually grant a purchase bonus in the form of a
          token. Token represents your right to purchase a limited number of
          branded items on our website with the value of the token granted. The
          value of the token depends on your purchase history and will be
          determined at our own discretion. The token is only permitted to be
          used for purchases of a limited number of specifically marked goods on
          our website.
          <br />
          We reserve all rights, title and interest, and all related
          intellectual property rights in and to the tokens produced by us. You
          only are granted a limited, revocable, non-transferable license to use
          the token, and you agree that you do not own them.
          <br />
          <br />
          In no way can the token or its value be exchanged with us or anyone
          else for real money (traditional currency, any other open digital
          currency), goods, other items, or services of monetary value, except
          of stated hereunder. The transfer of token is prohibited except where
          expressly authorized hereunder. Other than expressly authorized
          hereunder you shall not sell, redeem or otherwise transfer token to
          any person or entity, another website user or any third party. Value
          and availability of tokens are subject to change without notice. The
          token is not an instrument of exchange and payment, which please note.
          <br />
          <br />
          We may manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate available tokens
          as well as goods available to purchase with tokens, at any time with
          our notice. We shall have no liability to you or any third party in
          the event that we exercise any such rights.
          <br />
          <br />
          Risk of Loss

          <br />

          a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for
          such items passes to You upon our delivery to the carrier.
